### About Me

I am a second year PhD student in Health Policy with a concentration in Methods for Policy Research at Harvard University. My research interests are in the areas of social policy, population health, and health services research with a focus on reproductive health and mental health. I am a research fellow in the Division of Health Policy & Insurance Research (HPI) in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School & Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. In Spring 2025, I was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

Prior to starting graduate school, I was a Pre-Doctoral Statistical Programmer Analyst in the Department of Health Policy & Management and Center for Mental Health & Addiction Policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. While at Hopkins I primarily worked on projects related to health insurance design and mental health and substance use disorder outcomes.
