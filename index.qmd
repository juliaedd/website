### About Me

I am a second year PhD student in Health Policy with a concentration in Methods for Policy Research at Harvard University. My research interests are in the areas of social policy, population health, and health services research with a focus on reproductive health and mental health.

Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Statistical Programmer Analyst in the Department of Health Policy & Management and Center for Mental Health & Addiction Policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. While at Hopkins I primarily worked on projects related to health insurance design and mental health and substance use disorder outcomes.
