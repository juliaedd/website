### About Me

I am a third year PhD Candidate in Health Policy with a concentration in Methods for Policy Research at Harvard University. My research interests focus on population health policy and health services research related to reproductive, maternal, and mental health. I am specifically interested in studying mental health among pregnant and postpartum people, intimate partner violence, and policy approaches to reducing pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. 

I am a research fellow in the Division of Health Policy & Insurance Research (HPI) in the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School & Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. In Spring 2025, I was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Prior to starting graduate school, I was a Pre-Doctoral Statistical Programmer Analyst in the Department of Health Policy & Management and Center for Mental Health & Addiction Policy at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. While at Hopkins I primarily worked on projects related to health insurance design and mental health and substance use disorder outcomes. I hold a B.S. in Policy Analysis & Management from the Cornell University Brooks School of Public Policy.
